📚 I BUILT A FULL-FEATURED BOOK WEB APP USING DJANGO + MS SQL SERVER!

Hello connections! 👋

Over the past few weeks, I’ve developed a dynamic web application for book management that supports both user and admin interactions, secure login/logout, image uploads, and user reviews — all built using Django’s MVT architecture.

Here’s what makes it powerful: 🧑‍💻 

🔧 Tech Stack:
✅Django – Robust Python web framework using the MVT pattern
✅Microsoft SQL Server – Reliable backend database via mssql-django
✅Tailwind CSS – Clean, responsive, and modern UI styling
✅HTML + Django Templates – Smooth frontend rendering
✅CSRF Tokens – Secure form handling
✅Django Forms – Simplified and validated user input
Pillow – Image upload & processing
tzdata – Timezone support

🧰 Core Features:🧑‍💻 
✔️User & Admin Login/Logout System
✔️Role-Based Interfaces – Separate user/admin views
✔️Image Uploads – Upload book covers securely
✔️User/Admin Reviews – Collect and display feedback
✔️Dynamic Book Pages – View descriptions, page count, and author details
Author Book Collections – Explore books by specific authors

🗄️ Database Design:🧑‍💻 
✅Books – Title, cover image, page count, description, etc.
✅Authors – Name, biography, and book linkage
✅Reviews – User feedback for books

♻️ Admin CRUD Operations:🧑‍💻
✅Manage books, authors, and reviews directly from the Django Admin Panel with full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality.
✅Whether you're exploring Django for full-stack apps, working with enterprise databases, or creating content-driven platforms — this project offers a practical, scalable approach!
